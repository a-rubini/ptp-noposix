TODO High Priority

TODO-ptpx:
1) clearing of Foreign Master records on ANNOUNCE_RECEIPT_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED - if performed,
   the exchange of roles between Master and slave does not work... need to ivestigate
2) secondary slave - only single is implemnted (which is fine for switch v2) but it needs tobe
   extended to many secondary slaves...
3) some error handling is missing



Known bugs:
1) When a port x is a primary slave, but then port y becomes primary slave, the port x, which
   should become secondary slave, does not enter UNCALIBRATED state and does not 
   start WR Link Setup. (grep for 'TODO: bug 1')
