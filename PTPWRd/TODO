- wrTimeouts - timeouts for LOCK state in initWrData() - check
- move WR FSM to master in WR Master mode
- change implementation of msg handle(), to accommdate the fact 
  that the announce MSGs should be handled in all WR states... 
- good idea for non-WRFSM-preemption implementation

- implement for more secondarySlavePorts
- timeouts seems to be not working !!!
