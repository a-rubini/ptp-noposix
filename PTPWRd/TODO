TODO-ptpx:
1) clearing of Foreign Master records on ANNOUNCE_RECEIPT_INTERVAL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED - if performed,
   the exchange of roles between Master and slave does not work... need to ivestigate
2) secondary slave - only single is implemnted (which is fine for switch v2) but it needs tobe
   extended to many secondary slaves...
3) some error handling is missing
4) add interface with HW for setting the order of secondary slaves (I will do when the 
   HW implementation is ready)
5) according to PTP standard clockIdentity should be stored in PtpClockDS, not in PtpPortDS.
   so it would be good to change it...
6) switch-over and the possibility of locking on multiple ports is not implemented in HW yet, thus
   I've introduced a very nasty hack, which is turned on with MACIEK_HACKs, as soon as HW 
   implementation is ready, I need to get rid of that. [this is mainly in ptpd_netif]

Known bugs:
1) When a port x is a primary slave, but then port y becomes primary slave, the port x, which
   should become secondary slave, does not enter UNCALIBRATED state and does not 
   start WR Link Setup. (grep for 'TODO: bug 1')
2) the transition from PTP_SLAVE to PTP_UNCALIBRATED:
    (Recommended State == BMC_SLAVE && new_master != old_master)
   is not implemented (feature of the original ptpd).
